      <p>
        My first experience with an animal that needed a home was with
        <strong>Piu</strong>. I had no clue at the moment that I had her in a
        box, taking her home, that she would become so important in my life.
        It's been almost 13 years of grumpiness, companionship, love and purring
        on my chest every time I go to bed and when I wake up. ?????
        <br />
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Fofo</strong> came into our lives little by little. He lived at
        a neighbour's house and eventually learned how to climb my house's wall
        and began asking for food and to be petted. He became officially ours
        when the neighbour moved out and left him behind.
        <strong>Fofo</strong> is the most patient cat that I know and also one
        of the prettiest. Fofo means <em>'adorable'</em> in Portuguese and it
        suits him perfectly.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Isoldinha</strong> is the latest addition to the family. She was
        a really scared kitten, hissing every time we tried to get near to her.
        I started giving her food and each time she was coming closer.
        Eventually she let me pet her and that was a really important moment.
        After that, she began showing her real personality: she asks to be
        petted, likes to sleep on my lap and even enjoy belly rubs! But she is a
        bossy kitten! <br />She and <strong>Fofo</strong> became best friends.
      </p>
      <br />
      <span class="advice">
        If you end up adopting an animal or already have one, think about
        getting it neutered. It prevents unwanted litters and it's good for your pet's health.

            <p class="heading">Donations</p>
            <p>
              Many organizations depend on donations to function. They usually
              need food, medicine and cleaning products. The other option is to
              make a money donation.
              <br />You can pick an organization and find out what they need.

            <p class="heading">Adoption & Fostering</p>
            <p>
              If it's possible for you at the moment, consider adopting an
              animal. You would be saving a life and be rewarded with affection
              and gratitude.
              <br />
              If you have space in your home but can't make a long term
              commitment, you can foster an animal until the pet finds a forever
              home.

            <p class="heading">volunteer</p>
            <p>
              If you have some free time and like animals, you can be a
              volunteer at a shelter. You can also help spread the word about
              animals that are up for adoption in your community.
